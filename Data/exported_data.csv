Thus the competition for the solutions service and network business has heated up through acquisitions and especially through partnerships, which IBM has used to facilitate its change from solely producing hardware to adding solution services and software. One study concluded that IBM was able to make this significant shift by managing its alliance of networks according to three principles. First, that company alliance networks may be used not just for individual projects but to facilitate strategic change inside a company; second, that two principal mechanisms can bring about this change: (1) increasing speed of change through partners and (2) finding partners in areas outside existing competencies; and finally, that companies can shape their alliance networks by conscious actions.
